# Battle-Tested Patterns

These are the operational lessons to preserve when turning the factory into a mobile app workspace, Steam game workspace, SaaS lab, content machine, or internal improvement loop.

## 1. Queue, Not Fixed Phase Pipeline

Use a queue of small tasks instead of a rigid linear phase plan.

- Good: add the next `discover`, `research`, `review`, or `build` task when evidence calls for it.
- Bad: force every idea through every stage even after a kill signal appears.

Why: a factory should move attention to the current bottleneck, not worship a diagram.

## 2. Artifact-Only Workers

Workers should write one evidence artifact and avoid shared state mutation.

- Worker output: `artifacts/<task-id>.md` or equivalent.
- State update: orchestrator/reducer imports the artifact and updates queue, logs, and ledgers.

Why: multiple agents editing the same JSON, database row, or tracker creates race conditions, partial writes, and hard-to-debug corruption.

## 3. Single-Writer Reducer

Have exactly one component update shared state.

The reducer should:

- detect completed artifacts
- parse structured data blocks
- move tasks to done/failed/skipped
- update ledgers and summaries
- record parse failures without losing the artifact

If parsing fails, keep the task open and retry after the artifact is fixed.

For JSON array queues, never append raw fragments. Read, parse, update the in-memory array, rewrite the full file, parse it again, and restore a backup if validation fails.

## 4. One Pulse, One Task

Limit each worker run to one task.

Why: this prevents runaway loops, keeps costs bounded, and makes outputs auditable. If a task wants to do five things, split it into five tasks.

For small, low-risk queues, a single scheduled pulse may run commander, one worker task, and reducer together. Do this only when tasks have explicit auto-eligibility and the pulse has locking/idempotency.

## 5. Pain-First Scouting

Start from raw unmet need, not from technology or what would be fun to build.

Mix sources every discovery pass:

- user reviews and low-star complaints
- Reddit / forums / community threads
- X or social posts with real frustration
- support questions and Q&A sites
- competitor changelogs, issue trackers, and feature requests
- store pages, tags, wishlists, and review themes for games/apps

Avoid source monoculture. If all evidence comes from builders talking to builders, the factory may optimize for interesting implementation instead of painful demand.

## 6. Search and Fetch Are Different

Treat keyword search as discovery and page fetch as evidence reading.

- Search finds candidate sources.
- Fetch/read extracts claims, numbers, quotes, constraints, and contradictions.

Do not let search snippets become final evidence for market, legal, or platform decisions.

## 7. Review Gates Are Separate Thinking Modes

Keep these gates conceptually separate, even when one person runs them:

- Need: is the pain real and repeated?
- Distribution: can first users be reached?
- Scope: can the riskiest assumption be tested with one small artifact?
- UX/fun: is the first experience clear or compelling?
- Technical: can it be built and maintained cheaply enough?
- Platform/legal: do store rules, TOS, privacy, copyright, or claims block it?
- Outcome: what metric decides hot, stale, or rejected?

Why: builders are biased toward building; scouts are biased toward novelty; critics are biased toward rejection. Separate gates keep those biases useful.

## 8. Blockers Accumulate Before Interrupting Humans

Workers should not stop the whole loop for one login, paid API, publish action, or account question.

Default order:

1. Try a free or local substitute.
2. If no substitute exists, write a `## blocker` section in the artifact.
3. Let the orchestrator aggregate similar blockers.
4. Ask the human only when the same blocker repeats or blocks a high-value path.

A practical threshold is three similar blockers, but tune it by domain risk.

## 9. Notification Compression

High-frequency worker loops should not notify on every run.

Report periodically with:

- queue health
- promising opportunities
- stale or rejected items
- repeated blockers
- next-cycle focus

Why: too much notification trains humans to ignore the system.

## 10. Metrics Need Provenance

Every metric must say whether it is observed, estimated, or assumed.

Examples:

- observed: installs, wishlists, paid purchases, replies, playtest completion
- estimated: review-count proxy, traffic estimate, price-band inference
- assumed: expected conversion, estimated build effort, hypothetical retention

Never blend these into one score without preserving provenance.

## 11. Feedback Updates the Next Search

The learning output should change future discovery and evaluation.

Track:

- categories that produced good signals
- categories to avoid
- scout source quality
- critic calibration: what it approved that failed, and what it rejected too early
- build friction: tech stacks or asset scopes that repeatedly overrun
- distribution patterns that actually reached users

If learning does not alter the next queue, it is just a report.

## 12. Build the Smallest Artifact That Tests the Riskiest Assumption

For a mobile app, this might be a clickable prototype, permission-risk test, store listing draft, or local MVP.

For a Steam game, this might be a 10-minute loop, one mechanic prototype, capsule/copy test, playtest build, or trailer script.

Stop building when the artifact can answer the current question. Do not build a full product to test whether the pain exists.

## 13. Degraded Operation Beats False Failure

If a preferred tool, memory search, or external source fails, switch to a lower-tech path before marking the task failed.

Examples:

- read existing artifacts directly
- use local grep/search over ledgers
- use public pages instead of logged-in dashboards
- record an evidence gap instead of inventing a metric

Only fail when the task cannot produce a useful artifact under the constraints.

## 14. Domain-Specific Translation

Keep the core loop stable, but translate evidence and metrics by domain.

| Domain      | Demand Evidence                                                       | Small Artifact                                         | Outcome Signal                                        |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Mobile apps | app review complaints, repeated tasks, permission-sensitive workflows | prototype, local MVP, store copy                       | installs, waitlist, retention proxy, review sentiment |
| Steam games | review themes, tag gaps, streamer pain, modding demand                | vertical slice, trailer script, capsule/copy, playtest | wishlists, playtest completion, creator interest      |
| SaaS/tools  | forum complaints, spreadsheet workarounds, issue trackers             | CLI, web MVP, landing page                             | signups, replies, paid pilots, usage                  |
| Content     | search demand, Q&A repetition, paid info gaps                         | article, outline, landing page, sample lesson          | reads, saves, purchases, replies                      |

The mistake to avoid is copying the same metrics across domains.
