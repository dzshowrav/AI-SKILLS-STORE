# UI/UX, Cross-Platform & Testing

## UI Construction

- **Scale over Offset** for anything that must fit every screen; Offset only for fixed-size elements (icons, borders). Combine with `UIAspectRatioConstraint` to stop Scale from distorting, and `UITextSizeConstraint`/`TextScaled` for legible text at all sizes.
- Respect device insets: `ScreenGui.ScreenInsets` (CoreUISafeInsets/DeviceSafeInsets) for notches and rounded corners; never pin critical buttons into unsafe corners.
- Prefer native styling over image assets: `UICorner` (per-corner rounding), `UIStroke`, `UIGradient`, `UIShadow`, and the Styling system/StyleQueries where available — lighter than 9-slice images and theme-able. Verify availability per [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md#environment--scale).
- Layouts via `UIListLayout`/`UIGridLayout`/`UIFlexLayout` + `AutomaticSize`, not hand-positioned children — they reflow across resolutions for free.
- If the project uses Fusion/React-lua, component idioms win — see [community-libraries.md](community-libraries.md#ui-fusion--react-lua--roact).

**UI performance:** UI updated every frame (health bars, timers) must not trigger layout recalculation of large trees — isolate hot elements in their own container. Tween properties, don't re-create elements. Set `Visible = false` on hidden panels (invisible ≠ free if still being laid out); destroy screens you won't reopen.

## Cross-Platform UX

Assume every game runs on touch, gamepad, and mouse/keyboard unless the user says otherwise.

- **Input:** Input Action System (or `ContextActionService` in legacy projects) per [patterns.md](patterns.md#input-client) — never branch on `UserInputService.TouchEnabled` to build three separate input systems.
- **Gamepad/console:** every interactive GuiObject reachable via `Selectable`/`NextSelectionUp/Down/Left/Right`; set `GuiService.SelectedObject` when opening a menu; test that focus never traps.
- **Touch:** minimum ~44 px effective touch targets; keep actions away from screen edges reserved by the OS; `ContextActionService`-created touch buttons for gameplay actions.
- Detect the *active* input type via `UserInputService:GetLastInputType()` + `LastInputTypeChanged` to swap prompt icons (keyboard "E" vs gamepad "X" vs touch button) — players switch mid-session.
- **Accessibility basics:** don't encode meaning in color alone; support `GuiService.ReducedMotionEnabled` (skip/shorten camera shakes and large tweens when set); keep flashing effects mild.
- **Performance tiers:** treat low-end mobile as the baseline — test there, scale effects *up* for strong devices (particle density, shadows, texture tiers), not down from PC.

## Testing & Debugging Workflow

- **Multi-client testing:** Studio's multi-client Team Test / Start Server+Players for anything involving replication — single-Play sessions hide every networking bug. Server-script breakpoints during Team Test where available.
- **Network conditions:** Advanced Network Simulation (Studio Settings → Network) — test remotes and prediction at 100–200 ms latency with loss *before* shipping; it always works on localhost.
- **Profiling:** MicroProfiler/ScriptProfiler workflow and memory-leak watching per [performance.md](performance.md#measurement-never-optimize-blind).
- **Change verification:** prove a change works by driving the affected flow in a live session and asserting observable results — full workflow, condition-driven waits, and the command-bar VM-isolation pitfall in [verification.md](verification.md).

### Unit-testable architecture (framework-agnostic)

You don't need a test framework mandate — you need testable *shape*:

- Keep pure logic (damage formulas, economy math, inventory operations, state machines) in ModuleScripts that touch **no Instances and no services** — pass data in, get data out. These run under any runner (TestEZ, Jest-Lua, or a plain assert script) and even in CI via Luau CLI/lune.
- Push Instance access, remotes, and DataStores to thin edge scripts that *call* the pure modules. If a function needs a `Player`, pass the data it actually uses (userId, profile table) instead.
- If the project has a test runner, match its conventions; if not, offer a `Tests` folder with plain assert-based specs rather than forcing a framework.

### Error telemetry & logging

- Capture unhandled errors: `ScriptContext.Error` (server + client), forward client errors to the server via a rate-limited remote; log with script name and stack.
- Structured logging (`LogService` `Info`/`Warn`/`Error` with context where available; else prefix-tagged `warn`) — consistent, greppable, and off by default for debug-level spam behind a Configuration flag.
- **AnalyticsService** custom events for funnels (onboarding steps, purchase flows, feature usage) and economy events — instrument at ship time, not after the retention problem appears.
- Wrap telemetry itself in `pcall`; diagnostics must never crash gameplay.
