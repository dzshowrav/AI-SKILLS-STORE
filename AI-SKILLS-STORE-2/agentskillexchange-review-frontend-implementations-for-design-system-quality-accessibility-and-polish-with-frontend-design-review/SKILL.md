# Review frontend implementations for design-system quality, accessibility, and polish with Frontend Design Review

Audit frontend work against design-system rules, accessibility expectations, responsive behavior, and visual craft before merge or release.

## Prerequisites

Frontend code or screenshots, design-system references such as Storybook or Figma Dev Mode, accessibility review context

## Installation

Use the upstream install or setup path that matches your environment:
- npx skills add microsoft/skills
- git clone https://github.com/microsoft/skills.git
- pnpm install
- pnpm harness --list

Requirements and caveats from upstream:
- | [Python](#python) | 39 | -py |
- ├── plugins/ # Language-based plugin bundles (azure-sdk-python, etc.)
- ├── python/ # -> ../.github/skills/*-py

Basic usage or getting-started notes:
- bash
- Select the skills you need from the wizard. Skills are installed to your chosen agent's directory (e.g., .github/skills/ for GitHub Copilot) and symlinked if you use multiple agents.
