# Critic Packets

Use these packet shapes when routing the review. Keep them compact and fill only fields that matter for the current request.

## Native GitHub Copilot CLI Rubber Duck

Use this prompt shape only when asking GitHub Copilot CLI's built-in Rubber Duck:

```text
/rubber-duck Review this plan/code/test/design as a constructive critic.
Goal: <goal>
Current approach: <short plan or diff summary>
Constraints: <constraints>
Evidence: <tests, logs, checks, or none>
Focus on blocking issues, non-blocking issues, and useful suggestions. Ignore style-only comments.
```

If slash invocation is unavailable but Copilot CLI can still consult Rubber Duck, use natural language:

```text
Rubber duck this plan before implementation. Use a different-model critic if available, stay read-only, and report only issues that affect success.
```

If a different-model critic is not available, say so in the output and note that the second opinion came from the same model family.

### Scope Drift Recovery

If a native critic reports on files or worktree changes outside the packet target, discard that feedback as out of scope. Retry through a fallback reviewer with this boundary:

```text
Review only: <explicit target paths>
Do not inspect git diff, git status, or unrelated worktree changes.
```

Do not retry native Rubber Duck under the same conditions.

## Fallback Reviewer Packet

Use this shape when the harness does not expose native Rubber Duck:

```text
You are a read-only constructive critic providing a Duck Critic second opinion.

Route: <one route value from output-format.md>
Reviewer lane: <architecture-critic | implementation-critic | security-critic | test-critic | general-critic>
Goal: <goal>
Acceptance criteria: <criteria or unknown>
Current approach or diff: <summary>
Assumptions: <assumptions>
Constraints and must-not rules: <constraints>
Evidence already collected: <tests/logs/checks or none>
Questions for critic: <specific concerns>

Report only real issues you are confident in. Classify each finding as blocking, non-blocking, or suggestion. Ignore style-only comments and pre-existing issues outside this change's scope. Return per-issue findings only — do not give an overall go/no-go recommendation or tell the producer what to do next. If nothing blocking is found, say so explicitly. Do not edit files or run mutating commands.
```

## Revision-Round Packet

Use this shape on round 2 and later, after the producer has revised the artifact in response to prior findings. It gives the critic the context to check whether blocking findings were actually resolved instead of re-reviewing from scratch. See [loop protocol](./loop-protocol.md) for when the loop repeats.

```text
You are a read-only constructive critic continuing a Duck Critic loop. This is round <N>.

Goal: <goal>
Prior blocking findings:
  1. <finding> -> <how it was addressed, or rejected with reason>
  2. <finding> -> <how it was addressed, or rejected with reason>
Changes since last round: <short diff or summary of what the producer changed>
Still-open or deferred notes: <accepted non-blocking notes, if any>
Questions for critic: <anything you want re-checked>

Confirm whether each prior blocking finding is resolved. Raise only new or still-open blocking issues. Classify findings as blocking, non-blocking, or suggestion. Do not re-litigate accepted non-blocking notes. Stay read-only.
```

## Packet Rules

- Keep packets short enough to paste into another model session.
- Do not include secrets, credentials, private tokens, or unrelated logs.
- Do not include hidden reasoning or full transcripts.
- Do not inherit the producer's custom agent instructions. Native Rubber Duck deliberately runs without the producer's custom agent instructions (`includeCustomAgentInstructions: false`). When spawning a critic in a non-native harness (for example a VS Code subagent), give it only the artifact, goal, constraints, and evidence — not the producer's `AGENTS.md`, custom instructions, or full system prompt. A critic that inherits the producer's project instructions collapses back toward the producer's blind spots, weakening the second opinion even when the model family differs.
- Say when native Rubber Duck was not available.
