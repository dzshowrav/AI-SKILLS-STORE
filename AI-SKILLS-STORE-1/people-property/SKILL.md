## Cost Considerations

At $0.22 per call, Whitepages is the most expensive endpoint in the x402 suite.

| Scenario | Cost |
|----------|------|
| Single lookup | $0.22 |
| Verify address + person | $0.44 |
| Multiple candidates | $0.66+ |

**Tips to reduce costs:**
- Provide as much info as possible for accurate first-try results
- Use free sources first (LinkedIn, company websites)
- Use FullEnrich, PDL, Clado, firecrawl, WebSearch, WebFetch to get data that will make the queries more accurate
- Only use for essential lookups

## Limitations

- US-focused data
- Results depend on public records availability
- Some individuals may have limited information
- Recently moved individuals may show old addresses
- Unlisted/private numbers not included
