## 0.17.0 — 2026-05-12

### Features

- **Surface OpenAlex concepts in ranker top-N output** (F2).
  `search_openalex.py` now extracts up to 3 concepts per paper (top by
  score, level≥1, level-0 roots filtered out as too generic). `rank_papers.py`
  surfaces the `concepts` field in every preview entry so the host LLM
  can spot domain-cluster skew at triage time — e.g. a CRISPR/cancer paper
  mixed into an AAV-capsid top-N now shows `[{"name":"CRISPR","level":3},…]`
  rather than relying on title parsing. No ranker math change; no new flags.
  Closes the keyword-only-ranker friction confirmed in two example runs
  (Mamba comparative + AAV grant_background).
- **`rank_papers.py --archetype` documentation flag** — accepts (but ignores) `--archetype <name>` as a no-op. Archetype is and remains read from state. Agents that intuit the flag from the workflow doc previously got an argparse error and `rc=2`; now they get a clean envelope. Real tuning still goes through `--alpha/beta/gamma/delta`. Friction surfaced by the Mamba-vs-Transformer example run.


## 0.16.5 — 2026-05-12

### Features

- **G2 soft saturation** — `SCHOLAR_SATURATION_MIN_AXES` (default `4`, set `3` for soft mode) governs how many of the 4 novelty axes (papers / citations / authors / venues) must converge for a source to count as saturated. Hot ML topics like Mamba vs Transformer reproducibly converged on authors / venues / citations within 2-3 rounds while the papers axis stayed 70-100% on broad keyword reformulations; the prior strict-AND rule forced threshold tuning on every such run. Setting `SCHOLAR_SATURATION_MIN_AXES=3` lets such cases saturate naturally without weakening strict mode (which remains the default). When fewer axes are evaluable than `min_axes` — e.g. single-venue sources where the venues axis is skipped — the requirement falls back to "all evaluable axes", so axis-absence never silently weakens the rule. Per-source envelope and gate detail now carry `axes_passed` / `axes_required` / `axes_evaluable` for visibility.


## 0.16.4 — 2026-05-12

### Features

- G2 `saturation_overall` gate failures now include effective thresholds and a per-source pass/fail breakdown inline in the `detail` field, instead of just listing source names. Agents no longer need a second `saturation` subcommand round-trip to diagnose what failed. Example: `thresholds: new<30.0% authors<25.0% venues<30.0% max_cit<1000 min_rounds=2; pubmed=FAIL(new=70%, auth=22%, ven=15.2, max_cit=118, rounds=5) | openalex=FAIL(...)`. Surfaced by an end-to-end real-world run on GLP-1 / non-diabetic obesity systematic review.
- Saturation has a new "negligible activity" axis: once a source has met `min_rounds`, if its last round returned fewer than `SCHOLAR_SATURATION_NEGLIGIBLE_HITS` (default 5) hits, the source counts as saturated-by-exhaustion regardless of percentage axes. Without this, a narrow source like bioRxiv on a clinical topic that returns `{2 hits, 1 new}` reports `new_pct=50%` and blocks the overall AND-clause forever — a tiny-denominator artifact, not a genuine novelty signal. The `per_source` envelope now includes a `negligible_hits` boolean so gate diagnostics can distinguish exhaustion from genuine saturation.

### Bug fixes

- `_s2_citations.py` no longer crashes with `TypeError` when Semantic Scholar returns `{"data": null}` (observed after 429 cooldowns). The `body.get("data", [])` default was returning `None` instead of the default list because the key was present-but-null; `body.get("data") or []` is the fix. Without it the entire `build_citation_graph.py --source s2|both` run died with a Python traceback and no JSON envelope on stdout — a P1 violation.

### Documentation

- Document the HTML-delivery pattern: pipeline outputs markdown by design; polished HTML pages are rendered by the host coding agent. SKILL.md Phase 7, README capability tables (EN/CN), and the WALKTHROUGH docs (EN/CN) now include the rationale and an example prompt for the agent. No code change — the skill's contract stays markdown + `.bib`.


## 0.16.3 — 2026-05-12

### Documentation

- SKILL.md "Scripts reference" table now lists `search_dblp.py` and
  `search_biorxiv.py`. They were already documented in the Phase 1
  search-command examples, but missing from the central reference
  table — agents browsing only the table would skip them when
  planning multi-source coverage.


## 0.16.2 — 2026-05-12

### Bug fixes

- Three call sites (`extract_pdf.py --url`, `_pdf_fetch.py` Unpaywall
  API and PDF download) hardcoded `User-Agent:
  scholar-deep-research/0.1` — a stale version string from the
  pre-0.5 era. Replaced with the canonical `USER_AGENT` from
  `_common.py`, which already carries the live version + repo URL +
  polite-pool marker. The honest-bot identity is more likely to pass
  publisher UA filters than a bare `name/version` token, and the
  single source of truth means future version bumps don't leave the
  fetch headers behind. Caught while diagnosing why paper-fetch
  failed on GraphDTA — paper-fetch's own UA filtering bug is filed
  separately upstream.


## 0.16.1 — 2026-05-12

### Features

- arXiv 429 cooldown is now honored across processes. The per-source
  rate limiter's lock-file semantics changed from "last-call
  timestamp" to "earliest-next-call time", and a new
  `note_rate_limit_cooldown(source, retry_after_seconds)` helper lets
  search scripts push that gate forward when an upstream returns 429.
  `search_arxiv.py` calls it with `Retry-After` header (when present)
  or 90s default — sibling processes that share `SCHOLAR_CACHE_DIR`
  will now wait out arXiv's sticky penalty box instead of each
  hitting the wall in turn. Existing 0.15.x lock files auto-migrate
  on first write; tests cover cooldown wait, no-op on
  zero/negative, and never-pulls-gate-backward semantics.


## 0.16.0 — 2026-05-12

### Bug fixes

- `SCHOLAR_SATURATION_NEW_PCT` default bumped from 20.0 → 50.0 on
  the paper axis. The 0.13.x threshold was unreachable against real
  broad-topic corpora — the v0.15.1 end-to-end DTI validation needed
  2 rounds against 3 sources to advance G2 and still saw 78–93% new
  in round 2, far above 20%. Operators who want systematic-review
  rigor can pin `SCHOLAR_SATURATION_NEW_PCT=20` in their env. The
  author/venue thresholds (25%/30%) are unchanged — they had
  different conceptual headroom.


## 0.15.2 — 2026-05-12

### Bug fixes

- Fix contract bug in `references/agent_prompts/phase3_deep_read.md`
  step (d): the v0.15.1 instruction recorded WebFetch landing-page
  evidence with `depth: "abstract_only"`, but the `evidence` CLI only
  accepts `full` / `shallow` and would return `invalid_field`. The
  prompt now uses `--depth shallow` with a `webfetch_landing_page:`
  method prefix — the same prefix convention as failure modes A
  (`evidence_unavailable:`) and B (`topic_mismatch:`). No code
  changes; this is a docs/prompt fix only. Caught by the v0.15.1
  end-to-end validation run.


## 0.15.1 — 2026-05-12

### Documentation

- SKILL.md now documents host-native web tool enrichment alongside the
  existing MCP enrichment section, covering Claude Code (`WebSearch` /
  `WebFetch`), OpenCode (`webfetch`), Codex CLI, and the
  OpenClaw/Hermes/pi-mono/Manus pattern (route through configured MCP).
  Phase 3 deep-read prompt gains a step (d) — WebFetch the paper's
  landing page as the last resort before writing
  `evidence_unavailable`, with `depth: "abstract_only"` to flag partial
  coverage. Pure documentation; no code changes. Results are
  intentionally not piped through `apply_ingest` — host-native results
  lack DOI/authors/venue and would erode the corpus audit trail.


## 0.15.0 — 2026-05-12

### Features

- New `list_sources.py` script + `SOURCE_META` constant on every
  `search_*.py`. Orchestrators can now query the federated search
  registry by domain, index type, auth requirement, or
  needs-relevance-filter flag — no more grepping each script's
  docstring to plan which sources to hit. Schema in `_search_meta.py`,
  validated at discovery, errors surfaced under `validation_warnings`.


## 0.14.3 — 2026-05-12

### Internal refactor

- Adopt [towncrier](https://towncrier.readthedocs.io) for incremental
  changelog management. New PRs drop a fragment in `changelog.d/<slug>.<type>.md`
  and `towncrier build --version X.Y.Z` aggregates them at release time —
  no more hand-editing `CHANGELOG.md`. Past releases (0.13.x → 0.14.2)
  reconstructed from git log for completeness.

## 0.14.2 — 2026-05-12

### Features

- `safe_get()` SSRF guard in `_common.py`: resolves the URL host and
  refuses to fetch when the IP is private/loopback/link-local/reserved.
  Wired into the two user/upstream-controlled URL sites — `extract_pdf.py
  --url` and the Unpaywall-resolved `pdf_url` in `_pdf_fetch.py`. New
  `ssrf_refused` error code maps to `EXIT_VALIDATION` and the envelope
  carries a `next:` hint pointing to `--input` as the fallback.

### Internal refactor

- Replaced 4 silent `except ... pass` sites with `logger.debug()` calls
  (search-cache parse/write, advisory state writes, msvcrt unlock).
  Stdout stays envelope-only; diagnostics route through stderr.

## 0.14.1 — 2026-05-12

### Features

- `extract_pdf.py` gains `--ocr-backend
  {auto,rapidocr,ocrmac,easyocr,tesseract,none}` and `--ocr-lang
  <comma-list>`. `none` skips OCR entirely (saves ~10s model load on
  known-clean PDFs); the others force a specific docling backend. Meta
  now reports `ocr_backend` / `ocr_lang` / `do_ocr` for auditability.

## 0.14.0 — 2026-05-12

### Features

- New `--engine {auto,pypdf,docling}` flag on `extract_pdf.py`.
  `auto` (default) runs pypdf first and upgrades to docling (markdown
  output, layout-aware, built-in OCR) when the pypdf result looks
  scanned/sparse. docling is an optional dep (`pip install docling`);
  `auto` degrades gracefully with `engine_fallback_reason` when absent.
- `extract_pdf.py` gains `--idempotency-key`: cache stores the extracted
  text alongside meta so retries rewrite the `--output` file rather than
  just replaying the envelope.

### Documentation

- Phase 3 deep-read prompt now uses `.md` suffix for extracted text and
  explains the engine selector.
