# Publishing to Marketplace

Complete guide for publishing your VS Code extension.

## Prerequisites

1. **Publisher account** at [marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage)
2. **Personal Access Token (PAT)** from Azure DevOps
3. **vsce CLI** installed: `npm install -g @vscode/vsce`

## Creating a Publisher

1. Go to [marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage)
2. Sign in with Microsoft account
3. Click "Create publisher"
4. Fill in:
   - **ID**: Unique identifier (used in extension ID)
   - **Name**: Display name
   - **Description**: Optional

## Getting Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Go to [dev.azure.com](https://dev.azure.com)
2. Sign in → User Settings (top right) → **Personal access tokens**
3. Click **New Token**
4. Configure:

- **Name**: "VS Code Marketplace" (or any descriptive name)
- **Organization**: **All accessible organizations** ← Critical!
- **Expiration**: Pick a real future date such as `1 year`. The `Custom defined` field defaults to today's date in some Azure DevOps UIs, so a token issued without changing it is valid only for the current day — `vsce verify-pat` passes the same day, but `vsce publish` fails with `Access Denied: The Personal Access Token used has expired.` the moment the day rolls over.
- **Scopes**: Click **Show all scopes** if `Marketplace` is hidden, then under **Marketplace** check **Manage** (preferred — `Publish` alone may be rejected by some publish API paths even when `verify-pat` succeeds)

5. Click **Create** and **copy token immediately** (shown only once)

Before publishing, verify the token from the same terminal session that will run `vsce`:

```powershell
npx --yes vsce verify-pat -p "$env:VSCE_PAT"
```

If `verify-pat` fails but `VSCE_PAT` exists in the User environment, reload it into the current process before retrying:

```powershell
$env:VSCE_PAT = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("VSCE_PAT", "User")
npx --yes vsce verify-pat -p "$env:VSCE_PAT"
```

If you control the repository workflow, prefer a wrapper script over repeating manual environment-variable recovery steps. A small PowerShell wrapper can validate the current Process `VSCE_PAT` first, automatically fall back to the User-scoped `VSCE_PAT` when VS Code is still holding an expired process value, and then forward `vsce verify-pat`, `vsce show`, or `vsce publish` with the resolved token. This avoids the common failure mode where the User environment is correct but VS Code child processes still inherit a stale token from the older process environment.

## Login and Publish

```bash
# Login (first time or when token expires)
npx @vscode/vsce login <publisher-id>
# Paste PAT when prompted

# Verify login
npx @vscode/vsce ls-publishers

# Verify the PAT used by this terminal before publish
npx --yes vsce verify-pat -p "$env:VSCE_PAT"

# Publish new version
npx @vscode/vsce publish

# Publish an already-built VSIX (prevents packaging the wrong artifact)
npx @vscode/vsce publish -i ./my-extension-1.0.0.vsix

# Confirm an already-published version without failing the release script
npx @vscode/vsce publish -i ./my-extension-1.0.0.vsix --skip-duplicate

# Publish with version bump
npx @vscode/vsce publish minor  # 0.1.0 → 0.2.0
npx @vscode/vsce publish patch  # 0.1.0 → 0.1.1
```

> `vsce` option names vary by version. If `--packagePath` is rejected, check the local `vsce publish --help` and prefer the supported package input option such as `-i`. Do not paste help output into public logs if it displays PAT defaults.

## Pre-publish Checklist

| Item                        | Check                               |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `publisher` in package.json | Matches your publisher ID           |
| `version`                   | Incremented from previous           |
| `README.md`                 | Exists (lowercase!) and has content |
| `LICENSE`                   | Included                            |
| `icon`                      | 128x128 PNG, path in package.json   |
| `.vscodeignore`             | Excludes unnecessary files          |

## package.json Requirements

```json
{
  "name": "my-extension",
  "displayName": "My Extension",
  "description": "Brief description for Marketplace",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "publisher": "your-publisher-id",
  "icon": "images/icon.png",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/user/repo"
  },
  "categories": ["Other"],
  "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
}
```

## Valid Categories

```
Programming Languages, Snippets, Linters, Themes, Debuggers,
Formatters, Keymaps, SCM Providers, Other, Extension Packs,
Language Packs, Data Science, Machine Learning, Visualization,
Notebooks, Education, Testing, AI, Chat
```

## Version Constraints

- ✅ Valid: `1.0.0`, `1.2.3`, `0.0.1`
- ❌ Invalid: `1.0.0-beta.1`, `1.0.0-rc1` (prerelease tags rejected)
- Use GitHub Releases for beta distribution instead

## Inspect Package Before Publishing

```bash
# List files that will be included
npx @vscode/vsce ls

# Create VSIX without publishing (for inspection)
mkdir -p artifacts/vsix
npx @vscode/vsce package --out artifacts/vsix/my-extension-1.0.0.vsix
```

If the project has a repository-specific release hygiene test, treat that test as the source of truth for payload safety. `vsce ls` flags differ between CLI versions, while a project test can assert the exact entrypoint and excluded files required by that extension.

If a release test asserts the extension version inside docs or spec files (README, CHANGELOG, a `FULL_SPECIFICATION`-style file), bump **every** one of them together with `package.json`. A single doc lagging the package version fails the release gate even when the build itself is correct, so update the version in all asserted files before tagging.

## Packaging Runner Gotchas

- Treat the VSIX file as the completion source of truth. A quiet or truncated terminal is not success; confirm the artifact exists, has a fresh timestamp, and has a plausible size before moving to publish.
- If `vsce package` appears to hang inside a shared VS Code terminal during `vscode:prepublish`, check for active `node` processes and the expected artifact before retrying. Do not stack repeated `npx vsce package` attempts against the same output path.
- When terminal capture is unreliable, redirect package output to a log file or run the package command as a dedicated VS Code task, then remove any temporary task entries before committing.
- If prepublish already passed separately, still let `vsce package` run its configured prepublish unless the local `vsce package --help` explicitly documents a supported skip flag. Unsupported flags such as guessed `--no-prepublish` are a sign to check local help rather than continue by trial and error.
- Prefer `npx vsce package --out <file>` over ambiguous `npm exec -- vsce package --out <file>` forms. If `vsce` reports `Invalid version <path>`, the package path was parsed as a version argument; switch runner syntax rather than changing the version.
- Run `git status --short` after packaging and `vsce ls`, not only before committing. Repository prepublish scripts can regenerate tracked metadata or JSON formatting; if that happens after the release commit/tag, either commit the mutation before packaging or restore and rebuild the VSIX so the artifact matches the tagged commit.

## Post-publish Verification

- Treat Marketplace listing metadata and `vsce show` as eventually consistent. If publish logs, the pushed tag, and GitHub Release are successful but the listing still shows the previous version, do not republish immediately; verify the version-specific VSIX endpoint first.
- Use the version-specific package URL pattern `https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/gallery/publishers/<publisher>/vsextensions/<extension>/<version>/vspackage`. Some Marketplace endpoints return `405` for `HEAD`, so use a small `GET` download to a temp file and confirm HTTP 200 plus a plausible size before declaring the version missing.
- Compare the downloaded VSIX size with the locally packaged artifact or GitHub Release asset. Matching size is stronger evidence than a stale human-facing Marketplace page.

## Local VSIX Artifact Hygiene

Store generated `.vsix` files under `artifacts/vsix/` rather than the repository root. This keeps the root readable, makes cleanup scriptable, and reduces the chance of attaching or inspecting the wrong local file.

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force artifacts/vsix | Out-Null
npx @vscode/vsce package --out artifacts/vsix/my-extension-1.0.0.vsix
npx @vscode/vsce publish -i ./artifacts/vsix/my-extension-1.0.0.vsix
```

When you keep historical local builds, set a retention rule and prune old archives automatically. Keeping only the latest 10 local VSIX files is usually enough for rollback and spot-checking.

```powershell
$vsixDir = "artifacts/vsix"
Get-ChildItem $vsixDir -Filter "my-extension-*.vsix" |
  Sort-Object { [version]($_.BaseName -replace '^my-extension-', '') } -Descending |
  Select-Object -Skip 10 |
  Remove-Item -Force
```

If the project ships multiple package variants such as a release VSIX and a dev/coexistence VSIX, keep **all** of them under `artifacts/vsix/` except the one release artifact you intentionally attach. Apply the same hygiene checks to every variant so the smaller test build does not silently diverge from the release payload.

## .vscodeignore

Minimize package size:

```ignore
**
!package.json
!README.md
!LICENSE
!CHANGELOG.md
!out/**
!images/icon.png

src/**
test/**
node_modules/**
*.ts
tsconfig*.json
.github/**
.vscode/**
*.vsix
artifacts/**
```

## Updating Published Extensions

```bash
# Increment version and publish
npx @vscode/vsce publish patch

# Or manually update version first
npm version patch
npx @vscode/vsce publish
```

## Unpublishing

```bash
# Unpublish specific version
npx @vscode/vsce unpublish <publisher>.<extension> --version <version>

# Unpublish entire extension (use with caution!)
npx @vscode/vsce unpublish <publisher>.<extension>
```

## Release Completion Contract

When the user explicitly asks to release a VS Code extension, do not stop at a
version bump, commit, or push. Treat the release as incomplete until all of these
are done or explicitly blocked:

1. Package the VSIX under `artifacts/vsix/`.
2. Inspect the VSIX contents or run the repo-specific package integrity test.
3. Install the generated VSIX locally with `code --install-extension ... --force`.
4. Publish the exact VSIX to Marketplace.
5. Create and push the release tag.
6. Create the GitHub Release with the VSIX attached.
7. Verify through at least two non-stale channels, such as publish success output,
   `gh release view`, and `git ls-remote --tags`.

Marketplace metadata commands such as `vsce show --json` and the public item page
can lag immediately after a successful publish. If publish output, remote tag,
GitHub Release, and the attached VSIX asset are consistent, treat stale
Marketplace metadata as propagation delay and do not republish or bump again.

If a blocker appears after the version bump, report the state separately:
`Version`, `VSIX`, `Marketplace publish`, `Git tag`, and `GitHub Release`.

## GitHub Release After Marketplace Publish

When attaching the VSIX to a GitHub Release, pin the release to a full commit SHA if you use `--target`. Short SHAs can be rejected by the GitHub API.

```powershell
$full = git rev-parse HEAD
gh release create v1.0.0 .\artifacts\vsix\my-extension-1.0.0.vsix --target $full --title "v1.0.0 - Release title" --notes-file .\release-notes-v1.0.0.md
```

If you already calculate the VSIX checksum locally, record the **size** and
**SHA256 digest** in the release notes too. GitHub Release asset metadata then
becomes an independent proof of exactly which artifact was published, which is
useful when Marketplace metadata is still stale right after publish.

```powershell
$vsix = ".\artifacts\vsix\my-extension-1.0.0.vsix"
Get-Item $vsix | Select-Object Name, Length
Get-FileHash $vsix -Algorithm SHA256 | Select-Object Hash
```

After publishing, `vsce show` output can lag or sort versions unexpectedly. If you need a deterministic confirmation, run duplicate-safe publish against the exact VSIX and verify that the Marketplace reports the version as already published.

Marketplace metadata can be stale immediately after a successful publish. If
`vsce show --json` or the public Marketplace page still shows the previous
version, do not republish or bump the version just from that signal. First verify
the GitHub Release and remote tag:

```powershell
gh release view vX.Y.Z --json "tagName,name,url,isDraft,isPrerelease,publishedAt"
git ls-remote --tags origin vX.Y.Z
```

If `vsce publish` reported success and GitHub Release plus remote tag are present,
treat the Marketplace mismatch as propagation delay and recheck later.

## Marketplace URLs

- **Your extensions**: `https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers/<publisher-id>`
- **Published extension**: `https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=<publisher>.<extension>`
- **Statistics**: Available in manage portal after publish

## PAT Security & Persistence

### Persist VSCE_PAT safely (Windows)

```powershell
# 1. Set for the current terminal session (type directly – never paste into chat!)
$env:VSCE_PAT = "<your-pat>"

# 2. Persist to User environment variables (survives reboots)
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("VSCE_PAT", $env:VSCE_PAT, "User")

# 3. Verify without revealing the value
if ($env:VSCE_PAT) { "present (length: $($env:VSCE_PAT.Length))" } else { "missing" }
```

> ⚠️ `SetEnvironmentVariable` does **not** update already-open terminals.
> Open a new terminal (or restart VS Code) after persisting.

If a publish command still uses an expired token after you update the User environment, the current terminal probably kept the old process value. Reassign `$env:VSCE_PAT` from the User value in that terminal, then run `verify-pat` again.

### If the PAT was accidentally exposed

1. **Revoke immediately** at `dev.azure.com` → User Settings → Personal access tokens → Revoke
2. Generate a new token (same scopes)
3. Update `VSCE_PAT` with the new value

### Rules

- ❌ Never paste a PAT into chat, issue comments, or commit messages
- ❌ Never echo `$env:VSCE_PAT` – check existence/length only
- ❌ Avoid sharing raw `vsce publish --help` output when `VSCE_PAT` is set; some versions display the effective PAT default in help text
- ✅ Use `VSCE_PAT` env var; `vsce publish` picks it up automatically
- ✅ Set expiry ≤ 1 year and rotate on a schedule

## .vscodeignore – Recommended Exclusion Patterns

Keep the published VSIX small and free of dev-only artefacts:

```ignore
# Source & config (already compiled to out/)
src/**
**/tsconfig.json
**/.eslintrc.json
**/*.map
**/*.ts
!out/**

# Dev tooling
.vscode/**
.vscode-test/**
.github/**
node_modules/**

# Dev-only content (never ship to users)
docs/**
output/**
output_sessions/**
research/**
session/**
FULL_SPECIFICATION.md
AGENTS.md

# Secondary docs or local artifacts that are not needed in the VSIX
README_ja.md
artifacts/**

# Large or unnecessary assets
images/demo-animated.gif
*.vsix
```

> **Tip**: Run `npx @vscode/vsce ls` to preview exactly what will be packaged
> before running `vsce package` or `vsce publish`.

> **Gotcha**: `vsce ls --packagePath foo.vsix` does not enumerate entries; for
> packaged VSIX verification (e.g. confirming `node_modules/**` is excluded),
> open the VSIX as a ZIP and list every entry instead:
>
> ```powershell
> Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem
> $zip = [System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::OpenRead((Resolve-Path foo.vsix))
> $zip.Entries | Select-Object FullName, Length
> ```

### Judging `node_modules/**` exclusion

Before excluding `node_modules/**`, confirm `out/*.js` only requires `vscode`
and Node built-ins, with no live external imports:

```powershell
Select-String -Path out\*.js -Pattern 'require\("([^.][^"]+)"\)' -AllMatches
Select-String -Path out\*.js -Pattern 'import\("[^.]'  # dynamic imports
```

A `dependencies` entry that is only reached through a guarded dynamic `import(...)`
disabled in the extension host (e.g. a CLI-side SDK that exits early when
`vscode` is present) ships its entire transitive tree as dead weight. One real
case: `@github/copilot-sdk` → `@github/copilot` ≈ 285 MB → packaged VSIX 181 MB.
After moving the unused dep out and excluding `node_modules/**`, the same VSIX
dropped to ~45 KB (≈4000× smaller). Compare VSIX size against the previous
release; an unchanged-huge size usually means `.vscodeignore` is not actually
excluding `node_modules/**`.

### Marketplace auto-resolves relative-path images

When the README references images by relative path (e.g. `![demo](images/demo.gif)`),
the Marketplace web view and the in-VS Code extension details pane both resolve
those paths against `repository.url` in `package.json` and fetch the file from
`raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/<branch>/<path>`. So as long as the
image is committed and pushed to the default branch, you can keep it **out of
the VSIX** to drop multi-megabyte demo media without breaking the listing.

This auto-resolution applies to **images**, not to arbitrary Markdown links. If
you exclude secondary documents such as `README_ja.md` from the VSIX, link to
them with an absolute GitHub URL from the primary `README.md` instead of a
relative Markdown link.

A single 15 MB demo GIF can shrink a VSIX from ~15 MB to ~175 KB (≈99% reduction)

### Verify VSIX integrity before publish

`vsce ls` validates `.vscodeignore` filtering, but it cannot detect a truncated
or zip-corrupt VSIX (which can happen when the package step is interrupted by
build watchers or transient I/O). Always do a local install round-trip before
`vsce publish`:

```powershell
$cli = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\bin\code.cmd"
& $cli --install-extension artifacts\vsix\my-extension-1.0.0.vsix --force
# If you see:
#   Error: End of central directory record signature not found.
# the VSIX is truncated; rebuild it with `vsce package` and re-test.
```

Also treat `vsce package` completion based on the **output file** (size +
mtime), not on console messages — terminal capture sometimes drops the
`DONE Packaged: ...` line, but the artifact on disk is the source of truth.
If the VSIX exists but ZIP inspection fails, check whether `node` / `vsce` is
still writing the file. Once no package process remains, delete the corrupt
artifact, rebuild with a deterministic output path, and inspect that rebuilt
file instead of reusing the partial archive.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem artifacts/vsix/my-extension-1.0.0.vsix |
  Select-Object Length, LastWriteTime
```

If the extension manifest references icons such as `icon.png` for the Marketplace
tile and `icon.svg` for activity bar or command UI, add a release check that
asserts the referenced files physically exist before packaging.

## Post-publish Verification

`vsce show --json` is useful, but its metadata can lag right after publish.
Treat the publish command's result as the first source of truth and use at least
one more independent check.

- Run duplicate-safe publish against the exact VSIX and confirm `already published`
- If you use Git tags or GitHub Releases, verify the release/tag exists too
- If the Marketplace listing lags, do not republish a new version just because
  `vsce show` still returns the previous metadata snapshot
- If publish is paused by review, auth, duplicate, or permissions, report version, artifact, checksum, commit, tag, push, and publish state separately so the same VSIX can be resumed without guessing.
