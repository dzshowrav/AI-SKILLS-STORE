# Customization Primitive Selection

Choose the right customization primitive before creating files.

## Decision Matrix

| Need                                                                        | Best Fit               | Why                                                       | Avoid When                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Project-wide defaults that should apply to most work                        | Workspace instructions | Always-on guidance with low ceremony                      | The rule only matters for one task or one file type |
| File-scoped or task-scoped guidance                                         | File instructions      | On-demand discovery or `applyTo` matching                 | The content is really a reusable workflow           |
| Single focused slash command                                                | Prompt                 | Fast invocation with optional parameters                  | The task needs bundled scripts or rich assets       |
| Reusable multi-step workflow with bundled scripts, templates, or references | Skill                  | Best balance of reuse, discovery, and progressive loading | You only need a one-off command or always-on rule   |
| Persona with tool restrictions, delegation, or handoffs                     | Custom agent           | Lets you control role boundaries and tools                | The need is procedural, not persona-based           |
| Deterministic enforcement or lifecycle automation                           | Hook                   | Runtime guarantees, blocking, auto-validation             | Simple instructions are sufficient                  |

## Questions to Ask First

1. Is this guidance needed in most conversations, or only for a specific task?
2. Does the user need a reusable slash command, or always-on behavior?
3. Does the solution need bundled scripts, templates, or detailed references?
4. Is persona or tool restriction the core requirement?
5. Must the behavior be enforced deterministically?

## Scope Selection

Choose scope before creating the file.

| Scope        | Use When                               | Typical Location                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Workspace    | Shared with a team or tied to one repo | `.github/`                        |
| User profile | Personal preference across repos       | user profile customization folder |

Default to workspace only when the behavior should be shared through version control.

## Fast Rules of Thumb

- If the request starts with "always", it is usually an instruction.
- If the request starts with "when I type /", it is usually a prompt or skill.
- If the request needs scripts, templates, or structured references, lean toward a skill.
- If the request is about a specialist persona or safe tool boundaries, lean toward a custom agent.
- If a prompt only lists tools to make them available, remove `tools:`. Prompt-level `tools:` narrows availability; it does not request tools opportunistically.
- If the request is about blocking commands or auto-running checks, use a hook.
- Treat prompts, templates, quick actions, and canned responses as product surfaces: define grounding source, prohibited actions, output format, and unknown-handling before adding examples or tone guidance.

## Escalation Pattern

If you discover mid-design that the file type is wrong:

1. Stop editing the wrong primitive.
2. Explain the mismatch briefly.
3. Create or update the correct primitive.
4. Leave a short note in the related asset if cross-linking helps future maintenance.
