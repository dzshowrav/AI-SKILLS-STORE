# Verification Workflow

How to prove a change actually works — in the running engine, not just by reading the code. Complements the testable-architecture and multi-client guidance in [ui-ux-testing.md](ui-ux-testing.md#testing--debugging-workflow).

## Principles

- **Drive the affected flow end-to-end.** A change to a purchase path is verified by executing a purchase in a live session and observing the result. A clean typecheck or a passing pure-logic unit test is necessary, not sufficient, for anything that touches Instances, replication, or scheduling.
- **Condition-driven waits, not blind sleeps.** Test code waits for the observable condition with a bounded timeout (`repeat task.wait(0.1) until done or os.clock() > deadline`) instead of a fixed `task.wait(3)` — fixed sleeps make tests both slow and flaky. (Polling is legitimate *in test code*; the no-polling rule targets production code.)
- **Assert through observable markers.** Emit structured, greppable lines (`print("[TEST] key=", value)`) at the assertion points and read them from console output — a verification whose pass/fail can't be seen from the log wasn't a verification.
- **Replication needs multiple clients.** Anything involving remotes, replication timing, or StreamingEnabled gets a multi-client session (Team Test / Start Server+Players) — a single-Play session hides every networking bug.
- **Leave no residue.** Test scripts, tags, and instances created for verification are removed when done; prefer mechanisms that clean themselves up (see play-mode note below).

## Studio-native / MCP environments

- **Command-bar VM isolation (critical pitfall).** The Studio command bar — and MCP tools that execute Luau in the same plugin/command context — runs in a **separate Luau VM** from game scripts. `require()` there creates a *fresh instance* of the module with its own empty state: asserting on it tells you nothing about the running game, and calling its init/setup functions can double-register handlers on real shared resources (remotes, tags). Never assert game state through a command-bar `require`.
- **Inject test scripts into the game VM instead.** Write the test as a real `Script` (in `ServerScriptService`) or `LocalScript` (in a player's `PlayerGui`) whose `Source` is set from the command/plugin context — those run in the game's VM and share the game's module registry, so `require` returns the live module instances.
- **Play mode discards its changes.** Instances created *during* a play session are discarded when the session stops — injected play-mode test scripts clean themselves up. Anything injected in edit mode must be deleted manually afterward.
- Outbound network calls from a command-bar-required networking module can still be useful: the *traffic* reaches the real server handlers. What is invalid is asserting on the fresh module's local state.

## Rojo / filesystem environments

- Pure-logic modules (no Instances, no services — see [ui-ux-testing.md](ui-ux-testing.md#unit-testable-architecture-framework-agnostic)) run under the Luau CLI or lune in CI; match the project's runner (TestEZ, Jest-Lua, plain asserts) if one exists.
- CI passing does not exempt engine-touching paths from an in-Studio session — sync the change in and drive the flow there too.

## Review verification discipline (trace before flag)

When reviewing code (rather than writing it), findings must survive this filter before being reported:

1. **Trace paired logic on both sides.** Writer/reader, serializer/deserializer, encoder/decoder, fire/handler: an asymmetry between paired sites is only a bug if tracing *both* sides end-to-end shows a divergent outcome — one side may deliberately compensate for the other's behavior.
2. **Consider that the design is intentional.** Patterns that look wrong in isolation — state created before its data exists, caches that self-heal instead of invalidating, redundant-looking guards — are often deliberate. Check the usage sites and any header contract before judging.
3. **Demand a concrete failure scenario.** A reportable finding states inputs/state → wrong outcome. "This could maybe fail" without a scenario is not a finding; when practical, reproduce it (in a playtest or a unit harness) before reporting.
4. **Verify APIs against the target environment** before flagging them as wrong or nonexistent (SKILL.md → Environment & Scale) — never from memory alone.

These four steps are what keep a review objective: they filter out bias toward "code that looks different from how I'd write it".

Once a finding passes all four steps, assign it a severity — **Blocker**, **Correctness**, or **Advisory** — using the taxonomy and the full "what NOT to flag" catalog in [false-positives.md](false-positives.md). The gate decides *whether* a finding is real; the severity decides *how bad* it is. Advisory items are proposed, never reported as violations, and never silently rewritten.
