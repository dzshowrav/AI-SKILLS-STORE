## Common Commands

```powershell
python scripts/count_chars.py

# If Re:VIEW/PDF support is enabled:
# python scripts/convert_md_to_review.py
# python scripts/build_review_pdf.py
# python scripts/inspect_pdf.py pdf/book.pdf
```

## Workflow

1. Draft the structure in `keypoints/`
2. Write the manuscript in `sections/`
3. Review with `@writing-reviewer`
4. Convert with `scripts/convert_md_to_review.py` if Re:VIEW support is enabled
5. Build or polish PDF assets only when PDF output is in scope

## Metadata Layer

1. Put stable shared cover and colophon defaults in `config/review-metadata/common.yml`
2. Put project-specific author, publisher, title, subtitle, and series badge values in `config/review-metadata/project.yml`
3. If the repo contains a series, compare title naming patterns across books before fixing one title alone
4. Regenerate Re:VIEW config and cover assets through the helper scripts instead of editing generated files directly
