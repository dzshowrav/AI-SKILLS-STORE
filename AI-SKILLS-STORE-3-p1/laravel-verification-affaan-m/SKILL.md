# Laravel Verification Loop

Run before PRs, after major changes, and pre-deploy.

## When to Use

- Before opening a pull request for a Laravel project
- After major refactors or dependency upgrades
- Pre-deployment verification for staging or production
- Running full lint -> test -> security -> deploy readiness pipeline

## How It Works

- Run phases sequentially from environment checks through deployment readiness so each layer builds on the last.
- Environment and Composer checks gate everything else; stop immediately if they fail.
- Linting/static analysis should be clean before running full tests and coverage.
- Security and migration reviews happen after tests so you verify behavior before data or release steps.
- Build/deploy readiness and queue/scheduler checks are final gates; any failure blocks release.

## Phase 1: Environment Checks

```bash
php -v
composer --version
php artisan --version
```

- Verify `.env` is present and required keys exist
- Confirm `APP_DEBUG=false` for production environments
- Confirm `APP_ENV` matches the target deployment (`production`, `staging`)

## Phase 1.5: Composer and Autoload

```bash
composer validate
composer dump-autoload -o
```

## Phase 2: Linting and Static Analysis

```bash
vendor/bin/pint --test
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse
```

## Phase 3: Tests and Coverage

```bash
php artisan test
```

Coverage (CI):

```bash
XDEBUG_MODE=coverage php artisan test --coverage
```

## Phase 4: Security and Dependency Checks

```bash
composer audit
```

## Phase 5: Database and Migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate --pretend
php artisan migrate:status
```

- Review destructive migrations carefully
- Ensure migration filenames follow `Y_m_d_His_*` format
- Verify `down()` methods

## Phase 6: Build and Deployment Readiness

```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache
```

## Phase 7: Queue and Scheduler Checks

```bash
php artisan schedule:list
php artisan queue:failed
```

## Examples

Minimal flow:

```bash
php -v && composer --version && php artisan --version
composer validate
vendor/bin/pint --test
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse
php artisan test
composer audit
php artisan migrate --pretend
php artisan config:cache
php artisan queue:failed
```

CI-style pipeline:

```bash
composer validate && composer dump-autoload -o
vendor/bin/pint --test
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse
XDEBUG_MODE=coverage php artisan test --coverage
composer audit
php artisan migrate --pretend
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache
php artisan schedule:list
```
