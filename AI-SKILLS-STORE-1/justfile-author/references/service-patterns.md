# Service patterns (svc-* family)

The `svc-*` family is what makes these justfiles agent-friendly: every
long-running local service has a tmux-backgrounded sibling so an agent can
start it, read its output, and kill it without holding a foreground
process. This file documents the full surface area.

## The two-recipe pattern

For every long-lived service, emit **two parallel recipes**:

| Foreground (humans)         | Background (agents)                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `dev`        — Vite/Next/…  | `svc-dev`        — same, in tmux window    |
| `dev-proxy`  — proxy server | `svc-proxy`      — same, in tmux window    |
| `dev-worker` — queue worker | `svc-worker`     — same, in tmux window    |

The foreground variant is a one-liner that runs the package script. The
background variant delegates to `_svc-start` with the window name and
either the same package script or a `scripts/tx-start-<role>.sh` wrapper
(preferred when env activation is needed — see below).

## The internal helpers (`_svc-start`, `_svc-stop`)

These are private (underscore-prefixed) parameterized recipes that contain
the tmux logic. Every public `svc-*` recipe delegates to them so the tmux
boilerplate lives in exactly one place.

```just
_svc-start window cmd: tmux-new
    @session="{{ svc_session }}"; window="{{ window }}"; cmd="{{ cmd }}"; \
    export TMUX_SESSION="$session"; \
    if cortex tmux running "$window" >/dev/null 2>&1; then \
        echo "$window is already running"; \
    else \
        cortex tmux new "$window" --cwd "$PWD" 2>/dev/null || true; \
        cortex tmux send "$window" "$cmd"; \
    fi
    @export TMUX_SESSION="{{ svc_session }}"; cortex tmux read "{{ window }}" 20
```

Two non-obvious bits in this recipe:

- **`cortex tmux new --cwd "$PWD"`** is *idempotent-by-failure*: it
  errors when the window already exists, but `2>/dev/null || true`
  swallows that case, and the unconditional `cortex tmux send`
  afterwards delivers the command whether the window was just
  created or already there. This eliminates the explicit
  `tmux list-windows | grep` existence check earlier versions used.
- **`export TMUX_SESSION="$session"`** keeps cortex tmux on the same
  session that `tmux-new` created. Without this, `cortex tmux`'s
  fallback (cwd-derived, hyphen-normalized) can resolve to a
  *different* session name than the justfile's `svc_session`
  (project-slug-derived, often underscore-normalized) when
  `TMUX_SESSION` is unset in the caller's environment. The export is
  cheap insurance — every recipe that calls cortex tmux should do it.

A new svc recipe is a one-liner:

```just
svc-worker:
    @just _svc-start {{ tmux_worker_window }} "./scripts/tx-start-worker.sh"
```

## The full svc-* surface

Every justfile that has any service should expose this complete surface,
not just `svc-up`/`svc-down`. The orthogonal verbs are what make these
recipes agent-callable — an agent often needs to `svc-status` before
deciding whether to `svc-restart` something.

| Recipe                  | What it does                                          |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `tmux-new`              | Idempotently create the session.                      |
| `svc-<role>`            | Start one service window.                             |
| `svc-stop-<role>`       | Stop one service window.                              |
| `svc-restart-<role>`    | Stop then start one service window.                   |
| `svc-up`                | Start every service window. Deps: every `svc-<role>`. |
| `svc-stop` / `svc-down` | Stop every service window. Deps: every stop recipe.   |
| `svc-restart`           | Stop every service window, then start them all.       |
| `svc-reset`             | Kill the whole session and recreate it (the nuke).    |
| `svc-list`              | `cortex tmux list` — show every window.               |
| `svc-status`            | Per-service status block (loop, don't grep).          |
| `svc-read-<role>`       | Tail recent output (`cortex tmux read <window> 50`).  |
| `svc-session`           | Echo the session name (script-friendly).              |
| `svc-shell`             | Switch/attach to the session's shell window.          |
| `svc-attach`            | Alias for `svc-shell`.                                |

## The cortex tmux CLI

`cortex tmux` is the project-standard wrapper around raw tmux. Always use
it instead of `tmux capture-pane` / `tmux kill-window` / etc. — it gives
consistent error handling and stays compatible with future cortex changes.

### Window-level

| Command                                | Use case                                                |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cortex tmux new <win> [--cwd <path>]` | Create a window rooted at `--cwd` (defaults to `$PWD`). |
| `cortex tmux send <win> <cmd>`         | Send a command (presses Enter, clears partial input).   |
| `cortex tmux read <win> [N]`           | Tail last N lines of the window (default 50).           |
| `cortex tmux status <win>`             | Window name + last few lines of output.                 |
| `cortex tmux running <win>`            | Exit 0 iff the window's process is running.             |
| `cortex tmux kill <win>`               | Stop the window's process and close the window.         |
| `cortex tmux list`                     | List all windows in the active service session.         |
| `cortex tmux rename <old> <new>`       | Rename a window (use to label agent-claimed panes).     |

### Session-level

| Command                                              | Use case                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cortex tmux session-new [name] [--cwd <path>]`      | Idempotently create a session — re-runs return "already exists".    |
| `cortex tmux session-kill [name]`                    | Kill a session and every window in it (errors if it doesn't exist). |
| `cortex tmux attach [name] [--window <name>]`        | Attach (or `switch-client` if inside tmux); optional starting win.  |
| `cortex tmux sessions`                               | List every tmux session on the box.                                 |
| `cortex tmux snapshot [--lines N]`                   | Multi-session digest with last N lines per window.                  |

`session-new` is *idempotent by default*: if the session already exists
it returns success with an "already exists" message, so it's safe to
list as a recipe dependency that gets re-evaluated on every invocation.
`session-kill`, by contrast, errors loudly on a missing session — kill
is destructive and silent failure is the wrong default; recipes that
want fire-and-forget should append `2>/dev/null || true`.

### When to reach for `say` instead of `send`

For TUI agents (Claude Code, Codex) running inside a service window
rather than a long-lived process, use `cortex tmux say <win> <message>`
instead of `send`. `say` skips the `Ctrl-C` clear and inserts a settle
pause between text and Enter, both of which are required to safely
deliver a message to a debounced TUI input box.

## The tx-start-<role>.sh wrapper

The wrapper script in `scripts/tx-start-<role>.sh` exists to keep
**machine-specific runtime activation** out of the justfile. The justfile
should be portable across machines and CI; the wrapper is where nvm /
asdf / venv activation lives.

A wrapper script:

1. Resolves the project root from its own location, so the recipe can call
   it with any cwd.
2. Activates the runtime (nvm/asdf/uv/etc.) if applicable.
3. Sets env defaults (`PORT`, `DATABASE_URL`, …) using `${VAR:-default}`
   so the parent shell wins.
4. `exec`s the actual service command, so the wrapper PID becomes the
   service PID and `cortex tmux running` reflects reality.

See `assets/tx-start.sh.tmpl`.

## When to add a new service

A new `svc-*` recipe is justified when:

- The process is long-running (more than ~10s).
- A developer would otherwise want a dedicated terminal tab for it.
- It has logs an agent might need to read.

Skip the svc treatment for:

- One-shot tasks (migrations, seeders, codegen) — keep them as plain recipes.
- Things that already daemonize themselves (e.g., `brew services`-managed
  postgres, docker-compose services). Add a comment noting how to start
  them but do not wrap them in `svc-*`.

## When to add a TMUX_SESSION env override

The env override (`svc_session := env("TMUX_SESSION", project)`) is for
two cases:

1. A developer wants to run two checkouts of the same repo simultaneously
   without their tmux windows colliding.
2. CI or a test harness wants an isolated session per job.

Document the env var in the project README so contributors know it exists,
but do NOT set it in the justfile, .env, or shell rc — leave it unset by
default so the project slug wins.
