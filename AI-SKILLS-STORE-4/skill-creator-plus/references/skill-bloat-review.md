# Skill Bloat Review

Checklist for deciding whether a SKILL is growing by useful depth or by append-only accumulation.

## Review Order

Use this order every time:

1. Delete
2. Merge
3. Move to references
4. Add only what is still missing

## Triage Buckets

### Delete Candidates

- Stale guidance tied to old tool names or workflows
- Repeated best practices already stated elsewhere in the same SKILL
- Session-specific notes that are not reusable
- Long examples that do not change behavior

### Merge Candidates

- Two sections expressing the same rule with different wording
- Separate tables that should be one decision table
- Repeated warnings that belong under one principle
- Multiple mini-checklists that can become one review gate

### Move Candidates

- Sections longer than roughly 40-50 lines
- Large examples, schemas, command catalogs, or recipes
- Long external link lists
- Markdown-linked catalogs inside always-loaded entry files such as `copilot-instructions.md` or `AGENTS.md`
- Variant-specific guidance that not every invocation needs
- Repo-global instruction files that started absorbing domain-specific workflow detail

### Add Candidates

- Missing trigger guidance that affects discoverability
- A new decision point users repeatedly get wrong
- A reusable rule that cannot fit cleanly into existing sections
- A reference file that reduces main-file token cost

## Bloat Signals

- New sections are appended without rewriting old ones
- The same concept appears in three or more places
- Main SKILL reads like a knowledge dump instead of an operating guide
- References exist, but detail still stays inline in SKILL.md
- Line count grows while the core workflow becomes harder to find
- A workspace entry file such as `copilot-instructions.md` starts acting like a full operations manual
- Persona rules, routing rules, and domain workflow rules are mixed in one always-loaded file
- An always-loaded entry file becomes a Markdown-linked directory of rules, agents, or docs

## Hard Line Limits

Some skills ship a validator that hard-enforces the SKILL.md line count (see `opportunity-factory/scripts/validate_factory_skill.py` with a ~150-line cap). When adding several new sections would blow past the cap:

- Do not silently delete existing sections to make room
- Compress the added block into a single summary table with `references/<detail>.md` pointers, instead of expanding each new subsection inline
- Run the validator before choosing between subsection expansion and table form; discover the ceiling first, not after writing 200 lines
- Keep row ordering aligned with the load order the reader will follow (approval → autonomy → fallback → blocker gate → persistence, etc.)
- Reserve a small buffer (5–10 lines) for future rows so the next reflection does not require another restructure

## SSOT Externalization

When a section that lists hard rules, invariant items, or blocking gates keeps growing, expanding it inline pushes SKILL.md over the cap and creates duplication risk. Prefer externalization:

- Move the authoritative list to a `references/*.md` file (typically the same file that defines the domain, e.g. `references/rubber-duck-review.md` for blocking gates, `references/tunable-defaults.md` for hard rules)
- Leave one short paragraph in SKILL.md that names the concept and points to the reference. Two or three sentences is enough
- Never duplicate the list in both places; other references consume the SSOT via a see-also link, not a copy
- When the SSOT changes, only one file needs updating; consumers stay valid automatically
- This trades SKILL.md surface visibility for durability. Only externalize items the reader can safely follow a link for. Keep 5–7 core row concepts inline as the operating table

Example applied in opportunity-factory: hard rule list, Layer 3 blocking gate list, and reference default catalog are each SSOT in one references file. SKILL.md keeps a 3-line pointer instead of a 14-line bullet expansion, protecting the 150-line cap

## Keep vs Move

| Keep in SKILL.md                  | Move to references/     |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| What the skill is for             | Deep recipes            |
| Trigger conditions                | Large tables            |
| Core workflow                     | Implementation variants |
| Misuse-prevention decision points | Long examples           |
| Minimal review gates              | Link collections        |

## Entry File Note

For always-loaded entry files such as `copilot-instructions.md` and `AGENTS.md`, a short body is not enough.

- If the file becomes a Markdown-linked index, treat it as bloat even when line count still looks reasonable
- Prefer a one-line pointer to `instructions/`, `README`, or `docs` over a linked catalog in the entry file

## Decision Questions

- Can this replace an old sentence instead of adding a new paragraph?
- Is this needed on every invocation, or only sometimes?
- Does this teach the operating shape of the skill, or just document background detail?
- If this were removed from the main file, would the skill still route and operate correctly?

## Done Criteria

- Main SKILL still exposes the routing surface clearly
- Core workflow is visible without scrolling through recipes
- Duplicate rules are merged into one place
- Deep detail is loaded on demand via references
- New additions were made only after delete/merge/move was considered
