## Workflow

### Progress
- [ ] Analyzed user requirements (product type, style, industry, stack)
- [ ] Generated design system via `--design-system`
- [ ] Supplemented with domain searches (if needed)
- [ ] Applied stack guidelines
- [ ] Implemented UI with design system values
- [ ] Ran Pre-Delivery Checklist
- [ ] Delivered Changes Made summary

### Step 1: Analyze User Requirements

Extract from the user's request:

| Field | Extract |
|-------|---------|
| **Product type** | SaaS, e-commerce, portfolio, dashboard, landing page |
| **Style keywords** | minimal, playful, professional, elegant, dark mode |
| **Industry** | healthcare, fintech, gaming, education, beauty |
| **Stack** | React, Vue, Next.js — default to `html-tailwind` |

### Step 2: Generate Design System (REQUIRED)

**Always start with `--design-system`** to get comprehensive recommendations with reasoning:

```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux/scripts/search.py "<product_type> <industry> <keywords>" --design-system [-p "Project Name"]
```

This command:
1. Searches 5 domains in parallel (product, style, color, landing, typography)
2. Applies reasoning rules from `ui-reasoning.csv` to select best matches
3. Returns complete design system: pattern, style, colors, typography, effects
4. Includes anti-patterns to avoid

**Example:**
```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux/scripts/search.py "beauty spa wellness service" --design-system -p "Serenity Spa"
```

### Step 2b: Persist Design System (Optional)

Save for hierarchical retrieval across sessions with `--persist`:

```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux/scripts/search.py "<query>" --design-system --persist -p "Project Name"
```

Creates `design-system/MASTER.md` (source of truth) and `design-system/pages/` for overrides.

**With page override:** Add `--page "dashboard"` to create page-specific deviations.

**Retrieval rule:** Check `pages/<page>.md` first → if exists, overrides Master → otherwise use Master exclusively.

### Step 3: Supplement with Detailed Searches

After the design system, use domain searches for additional detail:

```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux/scripts/search.py "<keyword>" --domain <domain> [-n <max_results>]
```

| Need | Domain | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| More style options | `style` | `"glassmorphism dark"` |
| Chart recommendations | `chart` | `"real-time dashboard"` |
| UX best practices | `ux` | `"animation accessibility"` |
| Alternative fonts | `typography` | `"elegant luxury"` |
| Landing structure | `landing` | `"hero social-proof"` |

### Step 4: Stack Guidelines (Default: html-tailwind)

```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux/scripts/search.py "<keyword>" --stack html-tailwind
```

Available: `html-tailwind`, `react`, `nextjs`, `vue`, `svelte`, `swiftui`, `react-native`, `flutter`, `shadcn`, `jetpack-compose`

## Search Reference

### Domains

| Domain | Use For | Example Keywords |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| `product` | Product type recommendations | SaaS, portfolio, healthcare |
| `style` | UI styles, colors, effects | glassmorphism, dark mode, brutalism |
| `typography` | Font pairings, Google Fonts | elegant, playful, modern |
| `color` | Color palettes by product type | saas, ecommerce, fintech |
| `landing` | Page structure, CTA strategies | hero, testimonial, pricing |
| `chart` | Chart types, library recs | trend, comparison, funnel |
| `ux` | Best practices, anti-patterns | animation, accessibility, z-index |
| `react` | React/Next.js performance | suspense, memo, rerender |
| `web` | Web interface guidelines | aria, focus, semantic |

### Output Formats

```bash
# ASCII box (default)
python3 skills/ui-ux/scripts/search.py "fintech crypto" --design-system

# Markdown
python3 skills/ui-ux/scripts/search.py "fintech crypto" --design-system -f markdown
```

## Constraints

- Do **not** use emoji as UI icons — always use SVG icons (Heroicons, Lucide, Simple Icons)
- Do **not** skip Step 2 (design system generation) — it's required before implementing any UI
- Do **not** use `scale` transforms for hover states — they cause layout shift; use color/opacity instead
- Do **not** hardcode colors — always derive from the generated design system palette
- Do **not** leave interactive elements without `cursor-pointer`
- Do **not** ignore `prefers-reduced-motion` for animations

---

## Example

**Input:** "Build a landing page for a luxury spa brand"
**Workflow:**
```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux/scripts/search.py "luxury spa wellness service" --design-system -p "Serenity Spa"
```
**Output:** Design system with elegant/organic style, warm muted palette (sage, cream, rose gold), Cormorant Garamond + Montserrat typography, subtle fade animations, and anti-patterns to avoid (no neon colors, no aggressive CTAs).

## Common Rules for Professional UI

### Icons & Visual Elements

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use SVG icons (Heroicons, Lucide, Simple Icons) | Use emojis 🎨 🚀 as UI icons |
| Use color/opacity transitions on hover | Use scale transforms that shift layout |
| Research official SVG from Simple Icons | Guess or use incorrect logo paths |
| Use fixed viewBox (24x24) with w-6 h-6 | Mix different icon sizes randomly |

### Interaction & Cursor

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| `cursor-pointer` on all clickable elements | Default cursor on interactive elements |
| Visual feedback on hover (color, shadow, border) | No indication element is interactive |
| `transition-colors duration-200` | Instant or too-slow transitions (>500ms) |

### Light/Dark Mode Contrast

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| `bg-white/80` or higher opacity in light mode | `bg-white/10` (too transparent) |
| `#0F172A` (slate-900) for light mode text | `#94A3B8` (slate-400) for body text |
| `border-gray-200` in light mode | `border-white/10` (invisible) |

### Layout & Spacing

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| `top-4 left-4 right-4` floating navbar | Stick navbar to `top-0 left-0 right-0` |
| Account for fixed navbar height | Let content hide behind fixed elements |
| Consistent `max-w-6xl` or `max-w-7xl` | Mix different container widths |

## Error Handling

If the search script fails:
1. Verify Python is installed: `python3 --version || python --version`
2. Check the script path is correct: `ls skills/ui-ux/scripts/`
3. Run with help: `python3 skills/ui-ux/scripts/search.py --help`
4. Verify data files exist: `ls skills/ui-ux/data/`
5. If on Windows, try `python` instead of `python3`
6. Re-read the relevant section of this SKILL.md

## Changes Made (MANDATORY)

> [!CAUTION]
> **This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Every single UI/UX task MUST end with a "Changes Made" summary.** This is the LAST thing you do — present it before any other closing remarks. Never skip this step, even for small changes.

After completing any UI/UX work, present the user with a structured summary:

```markdown
## ✅ Changes Made

| # | File | Action | Detail |
|---|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | `index.html` | Created / Modified | <what was done> |
| 2 | `styles.css` | Created / Modified | <what was done> |
| 3 | `components/nav.html` | Created | <what was done> |

**Summary:** <1-2 sentence recap of the overall change>
```

**Rules:**
- List **every** file created, modified, or deleted
- Action column: `Created`, `Modified`, `Deleted`, `Moved`, or `Renamed`
- Detail column must be specific — not "updated file" but "added responsive navbar with dark mode toggle"
- End with a 1-2 sentence **Summary** of the overall impact

**Worked example:**

```markdown
## ✅ Changes Made

| # | File | Action | Detail |
|---|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | `index.html` | Modified | Added floating navbar with glassmorphism effect, hero section with gradient overlay, testimonials grid |
| 2 | `styles.css` | Modified | Implemented design system tokens (--primary, --accent), added dark mode media query, responsive breakpoints at 375/768/1024px |
| 3 | `assets/hero-bg.webp` | Created | Generated hero background image with WebP format |

**Summary:** Built a luxury spa landing page using the Serenity Spa design system with dark mode support and responsive layout.
```
